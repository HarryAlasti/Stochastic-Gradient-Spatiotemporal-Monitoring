% Instruction on how to use MATLAB files for level-based spatiotemporal monitoring using stochastic gradient method
===================================================================================================================
1. Run Wave_Generator.m file
2. Run STM_Level_Based_SG.m and be patient.
   Your computer needs to have sufficient memory.
3. Results are given as plots.

Thanks for your interest in running these MATLAB files.
